# Uncomment to active options. See dpkg-source(1)
#
# This file contains a list of long options that should be automatically
# prepended to the set of command line options of a dpkg-source --build call.

# This is normally for the non-native Debian packaging.

# Whenever possible, use debian/local-options instead to make dpkg-source long
# options applied for the team builds based on the VCS repository while NMU
# builds based on the Debian source package are not affected.
