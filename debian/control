Description: helper script to make the Debian source package
 This package helps you to convert a upstream source package (or VCS contents)
 into the Debian package by adding files required for the Debian source 
 package.  The generated debian/rules file uses the new dh command syntax from
 the debhelper (>=9) package.
 .
 The debmake command invoked in the upstream source tree without any option
 can generate template files which is good enough to create a single arch=any
 Debian binary package for local use.  The generated files should be edited to
 make it conform to the Debian policy if the package is uploaded to the Debian
 archive.  By adding few options, this command can generate template files for
 the arbitrary combination of the multi-binary and multi-arch package, etc.
 .
 This debmake command also scans copyright and license texts in the source
 files to help crafting the proper DEP-5 compatible debian/copyright file.
