=== *debian/copyright*

Debian takes the copyright and license matters very seriously. The ``Debian Policy Manual'' enforces to have summary of them in the *debian/copyright* file in the package.

You should format it as the http://www.debian.org/doc/packaging-manuals/copyright-format/1.0/[machine-readable debian/copyright file] (DEP-5).

The *debmake* command creates the initial DEP-5 compatible template file by scanning the entire source tree with its internal regular expression.  It also use nternal license checker to clasify each license text. footnote:[(The *licensecheck* command from the *devscripts* package was referenced to make this internal checker.]

NOTE: If you find issues with this license checker, please file bug to the *debmake* package with the header part of the problematic file.
