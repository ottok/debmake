=== New Debian revision

Let's assume that a bug report *#*'bug_number' was filed against your package, and it describes a problem that you can solve by editting *buggy* file in the upstream source.  Here's what you need to do to create a new Debian revision of the package with the *bugname.patch* file recording the fix.

----
 $ dquilt new bugname.patch
 $ dquilt add buggy
 $ vim buggy
 $ dquilt refresh
 $ dquilt header -e
 $ while dquilt push; do dquilt refresh; done
 $ dquilt pop -a
 $ dch -i
----

Please make sure to describe concisely the changes that fix reported bugs and close those bugs by adding "*Closes: #*'bug_number'" in the *debian/changlog* file.

TIP: Use a *debian/changelog* entry with a version string such as *1.0.1-1~rc1* when you experiment. Then, unclutter such *changelog* entries into a single entry for the official package.
