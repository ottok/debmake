=== Cherry-pick templates

Although executing the *debmake* command with the larger *-x*'[01234]' option in the upstream source adds new template files without overwriting the existing ones, it tends to leave too many unused ones and is quite messy.

If you wish to get some template files, I recommend to do it as follows with an empty directory, e.g., 'package/'.

----
include::../hello-c-0.0/ref/step101.log[]
----

Let's get the maximum amount of template files by specifying the *-x4* option.

Let's also use the "*-t -u* '0.0'" options to make missing upstream tarball with a version '0.0'.

----
sys::[head -n2  ../hello-c-0.0/ref/step200.log]
 ...
sys::[grep -A3  '^I: debmake -x' ../hello-c-0.0/ref/step200.log]
 ...
sys::[tail -n7  ../hello-c-0.0/ref/step200.log]
----

Letâ€™s inspect generated template files.

----
include::../hello-c-0.0/ref/step400.log[]
----

Now you can copy any of these generated template files in the 'package-0.0/'*debian/* directory to your package as needed.
