The *build-essential* package must be installed in the build environment.

The *devscripts* package should be installed on the maintainer environment.

Although this is not necessary the absolute requirement, it is a good idea to install and setup all of the popular set of packages mentioned in this chapter on the maintainer environment.  This enables us to share the common baseline working environment.

Please install the tools mentioned in the https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/developers-reference/tools.html[Overview of Debian Maintainer Tools] of the ``Debian Developer's Reference'', as needed, too.

CAUTION: Tool setups presented here are only meant as an example and may not be up-to-date with the latest packages on the system.  Debian development is a moving target.  Please make sure to read the pertinent documentation and update the configuration as needed.

[[email-setup]]
=== Email address

Various Debian maintenance tools recognize your email address and name to use by the shell environment variables *$DEBEMAIL* and *$DEBFULLNAME*.

Let's setup these packages by adding the following lines to *\~/.bashrc* footnote:[This assumes you are using Bash as your login shell. If you use some other login shell such as Z shell, use their corresponding configuration files instead of *~/.bashrc*.].

.Add to the *~/.bashrc* file
----
DEBEMAIL="your.email.address@example.org"
DEBFULLNAME="Firstname Lastname"
export DEBEMAIL DEBFULLNAME
----

[[mc-setup]]
=== mc

The *mc* command offers very easy ways to manage files.  It can open the binary *deb* file to check its content by pressing the Enter key over the binary *deb* file.  It uses the *dpkg-deb* command as its back-end.  Let's setup it to support easy *chdir* as follows.

.Add to the *~/.bashrc* file
----
# mc related
export HISTCONTROL=ignoreboth
. /usr/lib/mc/mc.sh
----

[[git-setup]]
=== git

Nowadays, the *git* command is the essential tool to manage the source tree with history.

You may wish to set several global configuration in *~/.gitconfig* such as your name and email address used by Git by the following.

----
$ git config --global user.name "Name Surname"
$ git config --global user.email yourname@example.com
----

If you are too accustomed to the CVS or Subversion commands, you may wish to set several command aliases by the following.

----
$ git config --global alias.ci "commit -a"
$ git config --global alias.co checkout
----

You can check your global configuration by the following.

----
$ git config --global --list
----

TIP: It is essential to use the *gitk* command to work effectively with the history of the Git repository.  

[[quilt-setup]]
=== quilt

The *quilt* command offers a basic method for recording modifications. For the Debian packaging, it should be customized to record modifications in the *debian/patches/* directory instead of its default *patches/* directory.

In order to avoid changing the behavior of the *quilt* command itself, let's create an alias *dquilt* for the Debian packaging by adding the following lines to the *~/.bashrc* file. The second line provides the same shell completion feature of the *quilt* command to the *dquilt* command.

.Add to the *~/.bashrc* file
----
alias dquilt="quilt --quiltrc=${HOME}/.quiltrc-dpkg"
complete -F _quilt_completion $_quilt_complete_opt dquilt
----

Then let's create *~/.quiltrc-dpkg* as follows.

----
d=.
while [ ! -d $d/debian -a `readlink -e $d` != / ]; 
    do d=$d/..; done
if [ -d $d/debian ] && [ -z $QUILT_PATCHES ]; then
    # if in Debian packaging tree with unset $QUILT_PATCHES
    QUILT_PATCHES="debian/patches"
    QUILT_PATCH_OPTS="--reject-format=unified"
    QUILT_DIFF_ARGS="-p ab --no-timestamps --no-index --color=auto"
    QUILT_REFRESH_ARGS="-p ab --no-timestamps --no-index"
    QUILT_COLORS="diff_hdr=1;32:diff_add=1;34:" + \
            "diff_rem=1;31:diff_hunk=1;33:diff_ctx=35:diff_cctx=33"
    if ! [ -d $d/debian/patches ]; then mkdir $d/debian/patches; fi
fi
----

See *quilt*(1) and file:///usr/share/doc/quilt/quilt.html[How To Survive With Many Patches or Introduction to Quilt] on how to use the *quilt* command.

See <<modpkg>> for example usages.

[[devscripts-setup]]
=== devscripts

The *debsign* command, included in the *devscripts* package, is used to sign the Debian package with your private GPG key.

The *debuild* command, included in the *devscripts* package, builds the binary package and check them with the *lintian* command.  It is useful to have verbose outputs from the *lintian* command.

You can setup these by the *~/.devscripts* as follows.

----
DEBUILD_DPKG_BUILDPACKAGE_OPTS="-i -us -uc"
DEBUILD_LINTIAN_OPTS="-i -I --show-overrides"
DEBSIGN_KEYID="Your_GPG_keyID"
----

Currently, RSA key with 4096 bits is good idea.  See http://keyring.debian.org/creating-key.html[Creating a new GPG key].

[[pbuilder-setup]]
=== pbuilder

The *pbuilder* package provides the clean room (*chroot*) build environment. footnote::[The *sbuild* package provides an alternative chroot platform.]

Let's customize it with several helper packages.

* The *cowbuilder* package to boost the chroot creation speed.
* The *eatmydata* package to boost the *dpkg* speed.
* The *ccache* package to boost the *gcc* speed.
* The parallel *make* to boost the build speed.
* The *lintian* package to find bugs in the package.
* The *bash*, *mc*, and *vim* packages in case build fails.

Let's create *~/.pbuilderrc* as follows.

----
AUTO_DEBSIGN="${AUTO_DEBSIGN:-no}"
PDEBUILD_PBUILDER=cowbuilder
HOOKDIR="/var/cache/pbuilder/hooks"
#MIRRORSITE=" http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/"
MIRRORSITE="http://cdn.debian.net/debian/"
#APTCACHE=/var/cache/pbuilder/aptcache
APTCACHE=/var/cache/apt/archives
#BUILDRESULT=/var/cache/pbuilder/result/
BUILDRESULT=../
EXTRAPACKAGES="ccache lintian eatmydata"
# enable eatmydata for pbuilder
if [ -z "$LD_PRELOAD" ]; then
  LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libeatmydata/libeatmydata.so
else
  LD_PRELOAD="$LD_PRELOAD":/usr/lib/libeatmydata/libeatmydata.so
fi
export LD_PRELOAD
# enable ccache for pbuilder
export PATH="/usr/lib/ccache:${PATH}"
export CCACHE_DIR="/var/cache/pbuilder/ccache"
BINDMOUNTS="${CCACHE_DIR}"
# parallel make
DEBBUILDOPTS=-j8
-----

NOTE: The parallel *make* may fail for some existing packages.

Let's create a hook scripts as follows.

*/var/cache/pbuilder/hooks/A10ccache*
----
#!/bin/sh
set -e
# increase the ccache caching size
ccache -M 4G
# output the current statistics
ccache -s
----

*/var/cache/pbuilder/hooks/B90lintian*
----
#!/bin/sh
set -e
apt-get -y --force-yes install lintian
echo "+++ lintian output +++"
su -c "lintian -i -I --show-overrides /tmp/buildd/*.changes; :" -l pbuilder
echo "+++ end of lintian output +++"
----

*/var/cache/pbuilder/hooks/C10shell*
----
#!/bin/sh
set -e
apt-get -y --force-yes install vim bash mc
# invoke shell if build fails
cd /tmp/buildd/*/debian/..
/bin/bash < /dev/tty > /dev/tty 2> /dev/tty
----

NOTE: All these scripts need to be set world executable: `-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root`.

NOTE: The *ccache* cache directory */var/cache/pbuilder/ccache* needs to be set world writable: `-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root` for the *pbuilder* command.  You should be aware of associated security concerns.

[[gbp-setup]]
=== git-buildpackage

You may wish to set several global configuration in *~/.gbp.conf*

----
# Configuration file for "gbp <command>"

[DEFAULT]
# the default build command:
builder = git-pbuilder -i -I -us -uc
# use pristine-tar:
pristine-tar = True
# Use color when on a terminal, alternatives: on/true, off/false or auto
color = auto
----

TIP: The *gbp* command is the alias of the *git-buildpackage* command.

[[proxy]]
=== HTTP proxy

You should set up local HTTP caching proxy to save the bandwidth for the Debian package repository access.  There are several choices:

* Simple HTTP caching proxy using the *squid* package.
* Specialized HTTP caching proxy using the *apt-cacher-ng* package.

[[repropro]]
=== Private Debian repository

You can set up a private Debian package repository with the *reprepro* package.
