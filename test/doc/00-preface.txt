== Preface

The *debmake* command is a helper script to generate Debian packaging files.

The *debmake* command is intended to replace functions offered historically by *deb-make* footnote:[This new *debmake* package starts its version from *4.0* to avoid version overlaps with its predecessor provided the *deb-make* command.] and *dh_make* commands.  Its features include:

* keep pre-existing Debian package configuration files untouched
* use of *dh* syntax under the new *debhelper (> 9.0)* package
** extensive check of copyright for *DEP-5* (with *licensecheck*(1) and more)
** substvar supports for binary packages
** support of compiler hardening options
* easy packaging command line UI supporting
** non-stop execution with clean results
** direct operation on the tarball archive
** direct operation on the source tree from VCS
** the multiarch Debian package
** the multi binary Debian package
** the non-native Debian packages from the VCS snapshot
** seamless work with *debuild*, *pdebuild*, etc.

NOTE: I wrote this *debmake* command because there was no easy command like "*python setup.py bdist_deb*" to create the Debian binary package.  Now "*debmake -d -s -b":python" -i debuild*" does the job for me.

I will describe the following to get you started with the *debmake* command.

* Quick guide for the *debmake* command
** This should be enough for you to get started with the *debmake* command, if you already know the similar *dh_make* command.
** Just browse this section first and come back later, if you are new to the Debian packaging.
* Top down view of the Debian packaging
** A rewrite in progress of the ``Debian New Maintainers' Guide'' for the *debmake* command.
* Bottom up tutorial for the Debian packaging
** Step-by-step examples of various packaging cases using simple model packages.
* Appendix: the *debmake*(1) manpage.

The */usr/share/doc/debmake/examples.tar.xz* tarball has the sources used for testing the *debmake* command and creating the examples in this document.

CAUTION: This document focuses to explain how to make a working set of installable Debian binary packages from the upstream source.  Much more details need to be addressed before uploading the package to the Debian archive.

Please read the basic Debian documentations together with this manual to generate perfect Debian packages.

* ``Debian Policy Manual'' -- "must follow" documentation (http://www.debian.org/doc/devel-manuals#policy)
* ``Debian Developer's Reference'' -- "best practice" documentation (http://www.debian.org/doc/devel-manuals#devref)
* ``Debian New Maintainers' Guide'' -- "tutorial" documentation (http://www.debian.org/doc/devel-manuals#maint-guide)
* ``Introduction to Debian packaging'' -- "tutorial" documentation (http://www.debian.org/doc/devel-manuals#packaging-tutorial)

TIP: There is an old Latin saying: ``*fabricando fit faber*'' (``practice makes perfect'').  It is highly recommended to practice and experiment with all the steps of Debian packaging with simple packages while reading this tutorial.
