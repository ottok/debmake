There is an old Latin saying: ``*fabricando fit faber*'' (``practice makes perfect'').

It is highly recommended to practice and experiment with all the steps of Debian packaging with simple packages.  This chapter provides you with the examples for your practice.

The */usr/share/doc/debmake/examples.tar.xz* tarball has the sources used for testing the *debmake* command and creating the examples in this guide.
