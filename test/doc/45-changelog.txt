=== debian/changelog

The *debian/changelog* file records the Debian package history and defines the upstream package version and the Debian revision in its first line.

The *debmake* command creates the initial template file with the upstream package version and the Debian revision.  The distribution is set to *UNRELEASED* to prevent accidental upload to the Debian archive.

The *debchange* command (alias *dch*) is used to edit this.

TIP: The date string used in the *debian/changelog* file can be manually generated by "*LANG=C date -R*".

This is installed in the */usr/share/doc/*'binarypackage' directory as *changelog.Debian.gz* by the *dh_installchangelogs*.

The upstream changelog is installed in the */usr/share/doc/*'binarypackage' directory as *changelog.gz*.

The upstream changelog is automatically found by the *dh_installchangelogs* using the case insensitive match of its file name to *changelog*, *changes*, *changelog.txt*, *changes.txt*, *history*, *history.txt*, or *changelog.md* and searched in the *./* *doc/*, or *docs/* directories.

After finishing your packaging and verifying its quality, please execute the "*dch -r*" and save the finalized *debian/changelog* file with the distribution set to *sid*. footnote::[If you are using the *vim* editor, save with the "*:wq*" command.]
