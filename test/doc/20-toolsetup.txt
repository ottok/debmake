=== Basic tool setups

Although these are not nessasary the requirement, basic tool setups are described as below for us to share the common baseline working environment.

==== Setting up *bash*

Various Debian maintenance tools offered by the *devscripts* package and *debmake* recognize your email address and name to use by the shell environment variables *$DEBEMAIL* and *$DEBFULLNAME*.

Let's set up these by adding the following lines to *~/.bashrc* foornote[This assumes you are using Bash as your login shell. If you use some other login shell such as Z shell, use their corresponding configuration files instead of *~/.bashrc*.].

----
DEBEMAIL="your.email.address@example.org"
DEBFULLNAME="Firstname Lastname"
export DEBEMAIL DEBFULLNAME
----

==== Setting up *quilt*

The program *quilt* offers a basic method for recording modifications to the upstream source for the Debian packaging. It's useful to have a slightly customized default suitable for the Debian packaging to avoid changing the behavior of the *quilt* command itself.

Let's create an alias *dquilt* for the Debian packaging by adding the following lines to the *~/.bashrc* file. The second line provides the same shell completion feature of the *quilt* command to the *dquilt* command.

----
alias dquilt="quilt --quiltrc=${HOME}/.quiltrc-dpkg"
complete -F _quilt_completion $_quilt_complete_opt dquilt
----

Then let's create *~/.quiltrc-dpkg* as follows.

----
d=. ; while [ ! -d $d/debian -a `readlink -e $d` != / ]; do d=$d/..; done
if [ -d $d/debian ] && [ -z $QUILT_PATCHES ]; then
    # if in Debian packaging tree with unset $QUILT_PATCHES
    QUILT_PATCHES="debian/patches"
    QUILT_PATCH_OPTS="--reject-format=unified"
    QUILT_DIFF_ARGS="-p ab --no-timestamps --no-index --color=auto"
    QUILT_REFRESH_ARGS="-p ab --no-timestamps --no-index"
    QUILT_COLORS="diff_hdr=1;32:diff_add=1;34:diff_rem=1;31:diff_hunk=1;33:diff_ctx=35:diff_cctx=33"
    if ! [ -d $d/debian/patches ]; then mkdir $d/debian/patches; fi
fi
----

See *quilt*(1) and */usr/share/doc/quilt/quilt.pdf.gz* on how to use the *quilt* command.

==== Setting up *devscripts*

The *debuild* command runs the *dpkg-buildpackage* and *lintian* commands under the current build environment with the sanitized environment variables to create all the files necessary for uploading a Debian package.

Let's create *~/.devscripts* as follows.

----
DEBSIGN_KEYID='Your_GPG_keyID'
DEBUILD_LINTIAN_OPTS=-i -I --show-overrides
----

With these, packages are signed by your specified GPG key ID (good for sponsoring packages) and checked in detail by the *lintian* command.

==== Setting up *pbuilder* + *cowbuilder*

The *pbuilder* package provides the clean room (*chroot*) build environment. The *cowbuilder* package boosts its processing speed. Let's customize these packages to make the *pdebuild* command to run with the *cowbuilder and *lintian* commands.

Let's create *~/.pbuilderrc* as follows.

----
AUTO_DEBSIGN=${AUTO_DEBSIGN:-no}
HOOKDIR=/var/cache/pbuilder/hooks
PDEBUILD_PBUILDER=cowbuilder
BUILDRESULT=../
-----

Let's create a hook script */var/cache/pbuilder/hooks/B90lintian* as follows.

----
#!/bin/sh
set -e
apt-get -y --force-yes install lintian
echo "+++ lintian output +++"
su -c "lintian -i -I --show-overrides /tmp/buildd/*.changes; :" -l pbuilder
echo "+++ end of lintian output +++"
----

==== Setting up *git*

You may wish to set several global configuration in *~/.gitconfig* such as your name and email address used by Git by the following.

----
$ git config --global user.name "Name Surname"
$ git config --global user.email yourname@example.com
----
If you are too used to CVS or Subversion commands, you may wish to set several command aliases by the following.

----
$ git config --global alias.ci "commit -a"
$ git config --global alias.co checkout
----

You can check your global configuration by the following.

----
$ git config --global --list
----

TIP: It is essential to use the *gitk* command for Git repository.

==== Setting up *git-buildpackage*

You may wish to set several global configuration in *~/.gbp.conf*

----
# Configuration file for "gbp <command>"

[DEFAULT]
# the default build command:
builder = git-pbuilder -i -I -us -uc
# use pristine-tar:
pristine-tar = True
# Use color when on a terminal, alternatives: on/true, off/false or auto
color = auto
